# Bounding Box Regression with MobileNetV2

This project implements a bounding box regression model using TensorFlow and Keras with MobileNetV2 as the backbone feature extractor. The model is trained to predict bounding boxes for images from the Caltech Birds 2010 dataset.



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to predict bounding boxes around objects in images. The model utilizes transfer learning with MobileNetV2, optimizing for loss through bounding box regression.
